🔍 Insights Discovered from the Data

This project simulates a real PM analytics workflow.
Here are the key insights extracted from the datasets:

1. Ticket Analysis (Support Operations)

1. Billing and Payments generate the highest ticket volume.
2. Technical issues and Product issues follow closely.
3. Peak ticket load occurred on Jan 3rd, indicating a spike in user activity or system instability.
4. Average resolution time is 7.08 hours, signaling potential SLA improvement opportunities.
5. CSAT segmentation shows:
a. 60% High Satisfaction
b. 10% Neutral
c. 30% Low Satisfaction
   
→ High-priority and technical tickets correlate with lower CSAT.

2. Funnel Analysis (Product Growth)

1. The strongest conversion drop occurs from Signup → Onboarding.
→ This suggests confusion in early product setup or onboarding flows.
2. Overall funnel completion rate is 6%, indicating significant activation and monetization leakage.
3. Activation has a 50% dropoff, showing it’s a critical optimization point.

3. Segmentation Insights
1. Priority distribution is balanced, but High-priority tickets cluster around Billing and Payments.
2. Agent workload distribution is even, suggesting no single agent is overloaded.
3. Low-satisfaction segments are concentrated in delays above 6 hours.

📌 What These Insights Mean for a PM

This analysis reveals:
1. Where support resources may need reinforcement
2. Which product flows need UX/content updates
3. Which ticket categories require preventive product improvements
4. How funnel optimization can increase activation and revenue
5. How CSAT can be improved by reducing resolution time for high-priority categories

A PM would use these insights to drive:
1. Roadmap decisions
2. Support workflow changes
3. Engineering prioritization
4. CX improvement initiatives
5. Product onboarding experiments
